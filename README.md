# Linear-Regression
This project is centered around performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing Linear Regression using Python's Pandas library. The goal is to explore and understand the underlying patterns in the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and apply a linear regression model to uncover relationships between variables.
